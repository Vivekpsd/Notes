### 1.1 What is Docker?
- **Docker**: A platform to build, ship, and run applications using containers.
- **Key Features**: Lightweight, portable, isolated, and efficient for development and deployment.
- **Purpose**: Simplifies application deployment across different environments.
- **Core Components**: Images, Containers, Volumes, Networks, and Registries.
### 1.2 Why Docker?
- **Portability**: "Write once, run anywhere" across multiple platforms.
- **Lightweight**: Shares the host OS kernel, using *fewer* resources than VMs.
- **Isolation**: Ensures applications run in separate environments without conflicts.
- **Scalability**: Easily scale applications with container orchestration tools.
- **Fast Deployment**: Launch containers in seconds, improving CI/CD pipelines.
- **Consistency**: Eliminates "works on my machine" issues in development.
- **Cost-Efficiency**: Optimizes resource usage, reducing infrastructure costs.
- **Community Support**: Extensive ecosystem and public image repository (Docker Hub).
#### 1.2.1. Docker Workflow
1. **Develop**:
    - Developers write code and define dependencies in a `Dockerfile`.
    - Build an image using `docker build`.
2. **Ship**:
    - Push the image to a Docker registry like Docker Hub.
    - Share the image across teams or environments.
3. **Run**    
    - Pull the image on any system.
    - Use `docker run` to create and start containers.
4. **Test**:
    - Testers deploy the same image in a containerized environment for consistent results.

### 1.3 Components of Docker
1. **Docker Engine**:
    - Core runtime for building, running, and managing containers.
    - Includes three sub components:
        - **Docker Daemon**: Runs on the host, manages containers, images, and networks.
        - **REST API**: Allows interaction with the daemon programmatically.
        - **CLI (Command-Line Interface)**: Tool to issue commands to the daemon.
2. **Docker Images**:
    - Read-only templates used to create containers.
    - Built using Docker files and can be stored in registries.
3. **Docker Containers**:
    - Executable instances of Docker images.
    - Lightweight and isolated runtime environments.
4. **Docker file**:
    - A script with instructions to build Docker images.
5. **Volumes**:
    - Mechanism for data persistence and sharing between containers.
6. **Networks**:
    - Facilitates communication between containers and external systems.
7. **Docker Compose**:
    - Tool to manage multi-container applications using a YAML file(`docker-compose.yml`).
8. **Docker Registry**:
    - Storage for Docker images (e.g., Docker Hub, private registries).
