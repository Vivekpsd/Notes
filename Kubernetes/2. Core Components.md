### 2.1 Master Node:
- **API Server:** Exposes the Kubernetes API for interaction with the cluster.
- **Controller Manager:** Ensures the desired state of the cluster, managing tasks like scaling and updates.
- **Scheduler:** Assigns work (pods) to available worker nodes based on resource availability.
- **etcd:** A distributed key-value store for maintaining cluster state and configuration data.

### 2.2 Worker Node:
- **Kubelet:** Ensures containers are running in pods and reports back to the master node.
- **Kube Proxy:** Manages network traffic and load balancing between services and pods.
- **Container Runtime:** The software responsible for running containers (e.g., Docker, containerd).

### 2.3 Kubernetes Terminologies
- **Pod**: The smallest deployable unit, representing a single instance of a running process, possibly containing multiple containers.
- **Service**: A stable endpoint that provides access to a set of pods with load balancing and service discovery.
- **Deployment**: Manages the deployment and scaling of pods, ensuring the desired number of replicas and supporting rolling updates.
- **ReplicaSet**: Ensures a specified number of pod replicas are running at any time, typically managed by a Deployment.
- **StatefulSet**: Manages stateful applications, providing stable network identities and persistent storage.
- **DaemonSet**: Ensures a copy of a pod runs on all or selected nodes, often used for system-level tasks like logging or monitoring.
- **ConfigMap**: Stores non-sensitive configuration data in key-value pairs, accessible by pods or other resources.
- **Secret**: Stores sensitive information such as passwords, tokens, and keys.
- **Namespace**: A logical partition in a cluster for organizing resources and providing isolation.
- **Ingress**: Manages external HTTP(S) access to services, supporting load balancing, SSL termination, and URL routing.
- **Volume**: Persistent storage used by containers within pods, surviving pod restarts.
- **Node**: A physical or virtual machine that runs Kubernetes, containing services like Kubelet and container runtime to run pods.
