Kubernetes by default uses docker hub for pulling the images, but in case we need to use our own image, *we cannot use local image*, we have to upload our image to the docker repository by creating an account.

Also while building image out of docker file, need to follow proper convention
```
docker push miyoshashi/demo-webapp:tagname

[Public view](https://hub.docker.com/r/miyoshashi/demo-webapp)
```


### 4.1 Creating local image to push to Repository
- Assuming you already created a docker file with project
- Build the docker file
- And also perform *docker login*
- Once done, push the image

```bash
docker build -t miyoshashi/demo-webapp:02 .
docker login
docker push miyoshashi/demo-webapp:02
```

### 4.2 Deployment of our app in K8s
```
⚡miyoshashi ❯❯ kubectl create deployment my-webapp --image=miyoshashi/demo-webapp:02
deployment.apps/my-webapp created
```

```bash
⚡miyoshashi ❯❯ kubectl get pods
NAME                         READY   STATUS              RESTARTS   AGE
my-server-844b8dbcd-mtfw6    1/1     Running             0          45m
my-webapp-689ff6956b-gkhpl   0/1     ContainerCreating   0          11s

⚡miyoshashi ❯❯ kubectl get deployments
NAME        READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
my-server   1/1     1            1           48m
my-webapp   1/1     1            1           2m44s

⚡miyoshashi ❯❯ kubectl delete deployments my-server
deployment.apps "my-server" deleted

⚡miyoshashi ❯❯ kubectl describe pods

⚡miyoshashi ❯❯ kubectl get logs my-webapp-689ff6956b-gkhpl
⚡miyoshashi ❯❯ kubectl delete pod my-webapp-84487c778f-czkm5
```

### 4.3 Roll-out/ Set new image to pod
What if there is some upgrades to the app and you have new image in your repo as **:03**?

Now you want your pod to point to this latest image, but the app also shouldn't go down in the middle of this process (*k8s is smart and will only stop the current running pod once the latest pod is up and running*)

```bash
⚡miyoshashi ❯❯ kubectl set image deployment my-webapp demo webapp=miyoshashi/demo-webapp:03

deployment.apps/my-webapp image updated

⚡miyoshashi ❯❯ kubectl get pods
NAME                         READY   STATUS              RESTARTS   AGE
my-webapp-689ff6956b-gkhpl   1/1     Running             0          29m
my-webapp-7db566d8dc-c8d8j   0/1     ContainerCreating   0          4s

⚡miyoshashi ❯❯ kubectl get pods
NAME                         READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
my-webapp-7db566d8dc-c8d8j   1/1     Running   0          57s

```

### 4.3 Scaling an app
**Self Healing**: If your pod gets down because of some app crash, still kubernetes will restart it and make everything stable again.

But in middle of this restart, the app will not be accessible. To overcome this and to also pursue load balancing, we do *scaling of pods*
```bash
⚡miyoshashi ❯❯ kubectl scale deployment my-webapp --replicas=2
deployment.apps/my-webapp scaled

⚡miyoshashi ❯❯ kubectl get pods
NAME                         READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
my-webapp-7db566d8dc-c8d8j   1/1     Running   0          5h45m
my-webapp-7db566d8dc-dmfz2   1/1     Running   0          7s

```
