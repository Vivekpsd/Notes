**One web app communicating with mongodb**
Assuming you have on react app running with a simple form, which upon submitting will store the information to the mongo DB.

### 6.1 Pulling mongodb image from docker hub
```bash
⚡miyoshashi ❯❯ docker run -p 27017:27017 -d --name mongodb mongo:latest
Unable to find image 'mongo:latest' locally
latest: Pulling from library/mongo
```

### 6.2 Creating docker image of the app
```bash
docker build -t miyoshashi/node-db-app:02 .

docker push miyoshashi/node-db-app:02
```

### 6.3 Running application via docker
```
docker pull miyoshashi/node-db-app:02
docker run -d -p 27017:27017 --network my-net --name mongo mongo
docker run --network my-net -p 3000:3000 --name myapp miyoshashi/node-db-app:02
```

###  6.4 **Kubernetes** - *Multiple Container Deployment*
There are two ways to run this app via multiple container -
- Run multiple containers in same pod
- Run each container as separate pod
#### 6.4.1 Run containers in the single POD

**deployment-nodedb-app.yml** & **service-nodedb-app.yml** both in same YAML file.
Note in single container we are running multiple images
```yml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  # Unique key of the Deployment instance
  name: my-nodedb-app
spec:
  # 3 Pods should exist at all times.
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nodedb-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        # Apply this label to pods and default
        # the Deployment label selector to this value
        app: nodedb-app
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nodedb-app
        # Run this image
        image: miyoshashi/node-db-app:02
      - name: mongodb
        # Run this image
        image: mongo:latest
---

kind: Service
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  # Unique key of the Service instance
  name: service-nodedb-app
spec:
  ports:
    # Accept traffic sent to port 80
    - name: http
      port: 8080
      targetPort: 3000
  selector:
    # Loadbalance traffic across Pods matching
    # this label selector
    app: nodedb-app
  # Create an HA proxy in the cloud provider
  # with an External IP address - *Only supported
  # by some cloud providers* 
  type: LoadBalancer
```
