### 1.1 What is Kubernetes?
- **Kubernetes**: An open-source platform for automating container deployment, scaling, and management.
- **Origin**: Developed by Google, now maintained by the CNCF.
- **Core Idea**: Orchestrates containers to ensure high availability and scalability.

### 1.2 Why Kubernetes?
- **Automation**: Manages deployment, scaling, and maintenance of containerized apps.
- **Resilience**: Restarts failed containers and replaces unhealthy ones.
- **Scalability**: Handles load by scaling containers up or down automatically.
- **Portability**: Runs anywhere (on-premises, cloud, or hybrid).

### 1.3 Use Cases?
- **Microservices**: Simplifies managing complex microservice architectures.
- **DevOps**: Streamlines CI/CD pipelines and testing environments.
- **Cloud-Native Applications**: Enables seamless app deployment on cloud platforms.
- **Resource Optimization**: Efficiently schedules containers on available hardware.
- **Disaster Recovery**: Ensures app uptime with self-healing capabilities.
